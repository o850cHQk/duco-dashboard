# Repo has been archived. revox has said this could get you/me banned (dont think it will but anyway) A new project is being done [here](https://github.com/o850cHQk/duco-dash) that is a simple self hosted version of this dashboad

# Duino Coin Dashboard
This is a Duino Coin Dashboard alternative

Instead of having everything probe the main duco servers I wanted something that i could access and get a little more analitics and whatnot.

# Check it out

There is a public instance of this running at [https://duco.tcmeta.net](https://duco.tcmeta.net) if you would like to use it without the fuss.

# Installation

This project is designed to run on standard webhosting services or run it yourself with a LAMP setup. You will also need to setup the [Duinocoin Dashboard Node](https://github.com/o850cHQk/duco-dashboard-node) but this needs to be done after you have setup the site.

- Download the github repo and extract it to your pc
- Rename the config.example.php in api/v1/config to config.php and edit the values in there
- Import the database.sql file to your mysql database to set it up
- Upload the contense of the repo to your website (this can be done by ftp, sftp etc.)

All done! The website should be ready to accept your worker node and also duino coin users. Head over to [Duinocoin Dashboard Node](https://github.com/o850cHQk/duco-dashboard-node) to set this up now.
