# duco-dashboard
This is a Duino Coin Dashboard alternative

Instead of having everything probe the main duco servers I wanted something that i could access and get a little more analitics and whatnot.

# Helpfull projects

The front end was made possible by [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/#intro), [charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [jquery](https://jquery.com/) and also [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
Of course a lot of thanks to the lads over at [Duino Coin](https://duinocoin.com/).
